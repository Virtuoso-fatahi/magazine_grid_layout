                If you work hard, you will become successful, and once you become successful, then you’ll be happy.
                Success first, happiness second. The formula is wrong because it is backward. 

            </p>
            <p>
                Waiting to be happy limits
                our brain’s potential for success, whereas cultivating positive brains makes
                us more motivated, efficient, resilient, creative, and productive, which drives performance upward.
                Every year the age threshold of unhappiness sinks lower, not just at universities but across the nation.
                Fifty years ago, the mean onset age of depression was 29.5 years old. Today, it is almost exactly half
                that: 14.5 years old.

                You can eliminate depression without making someone happy. You can cure anxiety without teaching someone
                optimism. You can return someone to work without improving their job performance. If all you strive for
                is diminishing the bad, you’ll only attain the average and you’ll miss out entirely on the opportunity
                to exceed the average.
                This pattern of focusing on the negative pervades not only our research and schools but our society.
                Turn on the news, and the majority of airtime is spent on accidents, corruption, murders, abuse. This
                focus on the negative tricks our brains into believing that this sorry ratio is reality, that most of
                life is negative.

                In the midst of stress, rather than investing, these individuals divested from the greatest predictor of
                success and happiness: their social support network. Countless studies have found that social
                relationships are the best guarantee of heightened well-being and lowered stress, both an antidote for
                depression and a prescription for high performance.

                    THE SEVEN PRINCIPLES

                            1. The Happiness Advantage
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Because positive brains have a biological advantage over brains that are neutral or
                            negative, this principle teaches us how to retrain our brains to capitalize on positivity
                            and improve our productivity and performance.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            How we experience the world, and our ability to succeed within it, constantly changes based
                            on our mindset. This principle teaches us how we can adjust our mindset (our fulcrum) in a
                            way that gives us the power (the lever) to be more fulfilled and successful.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            When our brains get stuck in a pattern that focuses on stress, negativity, and failure, we
                            set ourselves up to fail. This principle teaches us how to retrain our brains to spot
                            patterns of possibility, so we can see—and seize—opportunity wherever we look.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            In the midst of defeat, stress, and crisis, our brains map different paths to help us cope.
                            This principle is about finding the mental path that not only leads us up out of failure or
                            suffering, but teaches us to be happier and more successful because of it.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            When challenges loom and we get overwhelmed, our rational brains can get hijacked by
                            emotions. This principle teaches us how to regain control by focusing first on small,
                            manageable goals, and then gradually expanding our circle to achieve bigger and bigger ones.

                            6. The 20-Second Rule
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Sustaining lasting change often feels impossible because our willpower is limited. And when
                            willpower fails, we fall back on our old habits and succumb to the path of least resistance.
                            This principle shows how, by making small energy adjustments, we can reroute the path of
                            least resistance and replace bad habits with good ones.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            In the midst of challenges and stress, some people choose to hunker down and retreat within
                            themselves. But the most successful people invest in their friends, peers, and family
                            members to propel themselves forward. This principle teaches us how to invest more in one of
                            the greatest predictors of success and excellence—our social support network.
